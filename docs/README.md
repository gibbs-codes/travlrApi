# API Documentation Overview

This documentation set describes the Travlr API surface that powers the UI.
Each section contains request/response contracts, behaviour notes, and common
error patterns so the frontend can safely consume the backend.

## Contents

- [Trip Lifecycle Endpoints](api/trip.md)
- [Recommendation Endpoints](api/recommendations.md)
- [Error Handling & Conventions](api/errors.md)
- [Operational Notes](api/operations.md)

All examples are shown in JSON and assume the server is running on
`http://localhost:3006`. Update the hostname/port as needed for deployed
environments.
